Project Odin's Etch a Skecth assignment

This project will be divided in different stages:

1. Create a frame and the display where the squares will 
be created. (Not necessary, just for bragging).
2. create a 16 x 16 grid of square divs using only javascript.
3. Add a hover effect so divs change color when the mouse passes over.
4. Add a button so the user can select the number of squares
(maximum 100), erase the squares and create new ones.

extra:

a. Add a ramdomized color in each square.
b. Add a darkening effect with each mouse pass (10% each time)
